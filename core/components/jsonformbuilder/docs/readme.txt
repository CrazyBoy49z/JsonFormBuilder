FormItBuilder has been renamed JsonFormBuilder
==============================================
FormItBuilder has been renamed JsonFormBuilder. This is mainly due to limitations with the FormIt structure that FormItBuilder was built on. JsonFormBuilder has removed the requirement for FormIt meaning easier development of features. It also replaces the need to re-call snippets for the email TPL and therefore removes a lot of mess in chunks and the process of calling the form output commands.
Over time FormItBuilder will be removed.

=======================
What is JsonFormBuilder
=======================
JsonFormBuilder is a small framework to assist in quick development of forms and emails. Using a snippet (with some basic PHP commands) a complex form can be built much faster, and can automatically use the jQuery plugin "Validation" methods

JsonFormBuilders main purpose is to simplify form creation with a simple JSON structure mixed with any custom validation methods in PHP.
